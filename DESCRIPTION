Description: Tests for independence between X and Y computed from a paired sample (x1,y1),...(xn,yn) of (X,Y), using one of the following statistics (a) the Longest Increasing Subsequence (Ln), (b) JLn, a Jackknife version of Ln or (c) JLMn, a Jackknife version of the longest monotonic subsequence. This family of tests can be applied under the assumption of continuity of X and Y.
